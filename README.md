# USB-Styler

This is an old project built in 2007, using Visual Basic 6 and published for the first time at my ex-blog http://throglokan.blogspot.com.co/2007/05/usb-styler.html

> ### Goal
> The aim of the project is to show basic functionality on SO tunning, in this case customizing the appeareance of an USB once plugged > inside a Windows

### Use

You must use Microsoft Visual Basic 6 in order to open and run the code. If you just want to run the program, locate the application executables inside the bin folder

### Constrains

- The project only works in Microsoft Windows. I haven't checked (As the application is out of mainteniance), but probably it won't work in a MS Windows different from XP
- The project is built in an old technology, which is not used anymore.
- It's not i18n complaint and was originally written in Spanish


### Conclusion

Even thought it's an old project, it could be interesting for someone looking for understanding on how to achieve this kind of goals, and it was one of the first toys I built when I was still becoming a good coder.
